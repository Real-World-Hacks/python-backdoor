# python-backdoor
it is very powerful and undetectable payload 
FUDD UNDETECTABLE PYTHON BACKDOOR 

Fudd python backdoor  is fully undetectable again you would just
put your host ip adress="  save this file as a dot py
file and you can run it on any device
it so much harder for antivirus to detect it yes using Metasploit payloads are fun and they have a lot more functionality to them
but sometimes they get initial access or to keep access we can use tools like this to code or use our self coded tools  to make sure that we do get around by passing antivirus so we're gonna be
doing this on Windows  this would work on Mac this would work on Linux right away on

 Windows you will need Python installed as the prerequisite so
 the Windows machine that you're attacking will need Python installed but other than that it will work on Mac Linux UNIX
and all of that right from the get-go because they have Python pre-installed so you will need one thing I have config
and that will give you an internal IP address unless you're doing this remotely then you'd use your public IP address which you can Google from what
your IP address and then you need to port forward whatever port you're using in the payload and you do that inside of your router I'll make a video on port
forwarding shortly but we're not going to get into that right now so again it's just simply saved as a dot py file so it's named flood Python
backdoor and you would deliver this anyway you deliver a file an RDP session with a USB stick with your Apache server with any of the
methods that we showed you previously on
this channel so you just save the file put it on the target machine the victim machine and then double click it and itwill run and give you a shell so this is
the code this is very very basic Python because the better you code the better
hacker you can be in pen tester you could be  the same Wi-Fi public if you're doing it remotely and then I suggest using port
 because that will help you bypass firewalls now it is password protected because as a pen tester you don't want
someone finding your backdoor and using it because you don't want to risk your

clients getting hacked so that's always a good thing now I just made it something simple you can change it to
whatever you'd like and again just make sure you type everything as you see it
here and this will work for you and you will have a fully undetectable Python backdoor 

and just file click Save save it as whatever you want as long as it has the dot py extension so again I will show you the file and right here is
the payload and you can deliver deliver this any way you'd like through an RDP session through a team degree recession
through a USB stick physical access it doesn't matter as long as you get on the victim computer and double click it it will give you access so we're gonna use
netcat for our listener so let's go ahead and start that netcat listener said that gets pre-installed and Linux
go to your cmputer type these commands :
after replacing this file into victims device 
//commands:
         nc -nvlp 443
it asks login:backdoor // enter your password login if ypoud ont edit the code and see the password
and thatsall you entered succesfully on victims device terminal no antivirus will be detected
so you don't have to worry about that and again if you were to use this on
Linux you could simply copy and paste that script into the terminal
 and
actually just click enter and it will give you a shell also that might work on

Mac terminals as well and then again of course you can save the file and run it there's multiple ways this can be ran on

Linux and Mac windows it's a little bit different but it's still the same idea so the Windows computer that we are attacking is extremely well protected

Kaspersky antivirus which I suggest everyone use it's very very good for
being free and it even stops beef hooks and I haven't seen any antivirus do that
so let's go ahead and press ENTER and start that listener and go ahead and run the payload on the target device so I
simply just put the payload on the target device

it's asking me to login with the password which is backdoor and it's displays we have a shell have fun which you can see in the code right here which
you guys can change to say whatever you want and again it's extremely well calming it so you guys can hopefully
learn from this and learn basic Python Java scripting or talking scripting
whatever you or what have you so again it's windows commands it'll be terminal

commands or whatever terminal items you have and as you can see the Python it
should be on my dad desktop but you can see Casper key right
here and then you can see the flood Python payload which is the file which is currently giving me the shell which I can use to hack this Windows  device

now normally I would do a sis system info and this is all CMD command terminal commands on Mac you would use
Mac terminal commands but you have a connection and again we can close the connection open it back up and this being a backdoor it will run again as
long as the backdoor is active and can simply log back in and we have our shell so it's password protected which is
great for pen testers and because you don't want someone finding your backdoor when using it and to hack your clients
simply use the netcat listener and that cat has pre-installed on Linux so you're good to go the only prerequisite is
Python will have to be installed on any Windows device that you attack but Macsand Linux and UNIX you'll be good to go
right off of the bat so I'll give you a  quick look at the code again again
